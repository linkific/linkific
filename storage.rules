 *  - Public write access for resumes: Allows any user to upload a resume to the 'resumes/**' path.
 *    This is necessary for the public-facing application form.
 *  - Authenticated read access: Only authenticated users (i.e., employees on the dashboard) can read/download resumes.
 *  - File validation: Enforces that uploaded files are of common document types and are under 5MB to prevent abuse.
